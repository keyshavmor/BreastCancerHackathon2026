# Method walkthrough: HER2 scFv optimisation

Generated 2026-10-31T13:04:28.462064+00:00 from this run's own artifacts.

> **Claim boundary.** Every value below is a computational ranking signal for experimental triage. No affinity is measured or predicted. ipSAE is not K_D, ipTM is not ipSAE, and a higher score is not a demonstrated improvement. The parent is already a sub-picomolar binder, so the prior that any 5-8 substitution variant improves on it is low by construction.

## What was produced

| Deliverable | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Valid internal proposals (`internal_50_candidates.*`) | 50 |
| Designs with a real, externally computed ipSAE (`submission_scored.*`) | 66 |
| Ranked lab nominations (`top_15_scored.*`) | 15 |

| Boltz-2 structures computed | n/a |

Compliance audit: **PASS** (0 failed checks).

## 1. Immutable parent, verified not assumed

Every stage re-verifies the parent on import and aborts on mismatch, so no design can be built against the wrong scaffold.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Length | 242 |
| SHA-256 | `0b9248c76a2b399791c47dbfa0d252b18284265f1dbca9ae8e66c0dd018c9f64` |
| V_H / linker / V_L | 1-120 / 121-135 `(GGGGS)x3` / 136-242 |
| Native cysteines | 22, 96, 158, 223 |

CDRs are located by exact motif match rather than hard-coded indices:

| CDR | Span | Sequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CDR-H1 | 31-35 | `DTYIH` |
| CDR-H2 | 50-66 | `RIYPTNGYTRYADSVKG` |
| CDR-H3 | 99-109 | `WGGDGFYAMDY` |
| CDR-L1 | 159-169 | `RASQDVNTAVA` |
| CDR-L2 | 185-191 | `SASFLYS` |
| CDR-L3 | 224-232 | `QQHYTTPPT` |

## 2. Target: HER2 domain IV, derived from primary data

Built from RCSB `1N8Z` and UniProt `P04626` only. 1N8Z chain A is the Fab light chain, B the heavy chain, C the HER2 ectodomain; chain C is numbered in HER2 **mature** numbering (`uniprot = mature + 22`).

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Crop (mature) | 489-607 |
| Crop (UniProt) | 511-629 |
| Crop length | 119 aa |
| Intact disulfides in crop | 8 (0 split) |
| Fab-contacting HER2 residues retained | 37 |
| Boltz complex size | 361 residues |

The crop is validated three ways before anything is cofolded: it must not split a disulfide (checked against `SSBOND` records), it must retain every observed Fab-contacting residue, and its sequence must match UniProt exactly. Any failure is a hard exit. **The full ~630-residue ectodomain is never cofolded**, per the organizer's restriction, and the same crop is used for the parent and every candidate so all comparisons are matched by construction.

Caveats recorded: cropping removes receptor context and creates artificial termini, and crystallographic glycans are not modelled.

## 3. Candidate generation (AbLang2-guided)

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Raw proposals sampled | 40000 |
| Valid unique candidates kept | 40000 |
| Shortlist to ESM2 | 4000 |
| Mutation band | [5, 8] substitutions |
| Frozen tight-contact anchors | [50, 103, 165, 226, 227, 229] |
| Anchor cutoff | 3.0 A |
| Substitutions kept per site | 5 |
| Random seed | 20261031 |
| Runtime | 41.6 s |

Hard-filter rejections (the validator is fail-closed):

- `introduces 1 new N-X-S/T sequon(s)`: 2815
- `introduces 2 new N-X-S/T sequon(s)`: 64

Mutation-count distribution: {'5': 8369, '6': 10678, '7': 10965, '8': 9988}

**Mutation policy.** Fixed length 242, substitution-only, 5-8 substitutions (organizer minimum is 5; the upper bound is our own conservative choice). The linker and native cysteines are frozen, no new cysteines or N-X-S/T sequons are allowed, and residues within 3.0 A of HER2 in 1N8Z are frozen as probable hydrogen-bond or salt-bridge anchors carrying the sub-pM binding energy.

**Why four branches.** Fifty neighbours of one motif are not fifty hypotheses, so candidates are sampled from four independent mechanistic pools:

| Branch | Slots | Hypothesis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A_h3` | 20 | focused CDR-H3 maturation (strongest published evidence) |
| `B_interface` | 12 | non-H3 paratope and contact-adjacent positions |
| `C_mixed` | 10 | a few paratope edits plus compatible framework support |
| `D_framework` | 8 | framework-biased control retaining all anchors |

Selection within a branch uses farthest-point selection on Jaccard distance between mutated-position sets, which is what prevents the portfolio collapsing onto one motif.

## 4. Sequence screening with two orthogonal priors

AbLang2 asks whether a sequence still looks like a plausible *antibody*; ESM2-3B asks whether it still looks like a plausible *protein*. The models have different training distributions and different failure modes, which is the reason for running both. **Neither model sees HER2, so neither predicts binding.**

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Model | `esm2_t36_3B_UR50D` (bf16) |
| Candidates scored | 4000 |
| Mutable positions scanned | 223 |
| Cost per candidate | 61.7 ms |
| Peak GPU memory | 10.91 GiB |

**Numerical control.** 12 candidates were rescored in fp32: max |diff| 0.1330, mean |diff| 0.0433, NaNs present: False. This is immaterial for ranking; use `--fp32` if absolute scores are needed.

**Scoring design.** Each model is run once over the mutable positions to build a `position x amino-acid` delta-log-probability table; a candidate's additive score is then a table lookup. A second pass scores each candidate's mutated positions in its own context, which is the term that can see interaction between co-occurring substitutions. Making the expensive part pool-size independent is what allows a 40,000-candidate pool at negligible cost.

Ranking across models uses **rank aggregation of percentile ranks**, not a weighted sum of raw scores: AbLang2 and ESM2 log-probabilities are in incomparable units, and absolute thresholds borrowed from one model do not transfer to another.

## 5. Boltz-2 cofolding against HER2 domain IV

**MSA policy, and why it matters.** The ColabFold MSA server costs roughly 100 s per target and is rate-limited. It is called **once**, for the parent; both resulting alignments are cached and reused for every candidate, with only the query row rewritten to the candidate's own sequence. This is exact for substitution-only variants at fixed length, because every alignment column stays in register. Over a 150-design campaign this converts about six hours of mostly idle waiting into under an hour of GPU work, and it has a scientific benefit: every design is predicted under a byte-identical MSA condition, so parent-relative comparison is matched rather than assumed.

Identical crop, MSA condition, seed protocol, recycling and sampling settings are applied to the parent and to every candidate. Boltz-2's small-molecule affinity head is **not** used; it is not a calibrated antibody-HER2 K_D estimator.

## 6. ipSAE: computed externally, never proxied

Boltz-2 does not emit ipSAE. Each prediction's full PAE matrix and mmCIF are passed to the authoritative DunbrackLab/IPSAE implementation and the values parsed back.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Predictions scored | 67 of 67 |
| PAE cutoff | 10.0 A |
| Distance cutoff | 15.0 A |
| IPSAE commit | `6174cf9e71cb` |

Primary metric is `ipsae_min = min(asym B->T, asym T->B)`, the conservative of the two directional values. Chain order is `T` = HER2 domain IV, `B` = scFv. `ipSAE_provenance.csv` records the script commit, both cutoffs, the metric definition, the chain mapping and the artifact paths for every design.

A prediction with a missing or unreadable PAE, a PAE/structure residue mismatch, or a failed ipSAE run is recorded with a non-`PASSED` status and **excluded**. No ipSAE value is ever estimated, interpolated or carried over from another design.

**Parent baseline** (matched settings): ipsae_min 0.7213 +/- 0.0000 over ? seed(s); epitope recovery 1.0000.

**Epitope recovery** is reported alongside ipSAE: the fraction of experimentally observed 1N8Z epitope residues still contacted in the predicted complex. ipSAE cannot distinguish a correct interface from a confident but misplaced one, so a model recovering less than 30% of the known epitope is rejected regardless of its ipSAE.

## 7. Selection: multi-objective and diversity-aware

Ranking is deliberately **not** 'sort by ipSAE'. Four reasons: ipSAE is not calibrated to K_D; a small ipSAE gap can be smaller than seed noise; a confident model can bind the wrong face; and near-identical neighbours are not independent hypotheses.

| Axis | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| sequence_consensus | 0.3 |
| ipsae | 0.25 |
| epitope_recovery | 0.2 |
| structural_confidence | 0.15 |
| developability | 0.1 |

**Seed-noise gate.** Pooled ipSAE standard deviation across replicated candidates: **0.0000**. A design whose advantage over the parent is smaller than this is labelled `WITHIN_SEED_NOISE` rather than presented as an improvement. Designs exceeding the parent beyond that noise: **10** of 66.

**Sensitivity analysis.** Because the weights are a stated hypothesis and not a fitted model, the whole set is re-ranked under three alternative weightings (ipSAE-heavy, sequence-heavy, equal). Each design carries `max_rank_shift_under_reweighting`, so a nominee whose position depends on a single metric is visible as such.

Mutation lists for each nominee are in `top_15_scored.csv` (`mutations_1based`), and each sequence is independently reconstructible by re-applying that list to the frozen parent - a check the audit performs.

## 10. Limitations

- **No affinity is predicted.** ipSAE, ipTM, pLDDT, pDockQ and LIS are model confidence and interface-geometry measures. None is a K_D, and none is calibrated against sub-picomolar antibody binding.
- **The parent is very strong.** At 0.82 pM, assay floor and rebinding effects make improvement hard to demonstrate even experimentally.
- **Cropping changes the system.** Domain IV alone lacks receptor context, has artificial termini, and omits glycans. It is required by the organizer and applied identically everywhere, but it is still an approximation.
- **The MSA query-row reuse is an approximation**, exact in alignment terms for substitution-only variants but not a re-derived alignment per mutant.
- **Language-model priors are blind to the target.** AbLang2, ESM2 and ESM-C never see HER2; they can only reject implausible sequences, not identify better binders.
- **Selection weights are unvalidated.** They are a reasoned hypothesis; the sensitivity analysis quantifies how much the answer depends on them.
- **Single structure per seed.** One diffusion sample per seed; replicates quantify seed variance but not full conformational uncertainty.
- **No experimental feedback.** Without in-campaign assay data this is not Bayesian optimisation; it is one-shot constrained screening over model priors.

## Reproducibility

- repository commit: `be9699fc1e920f02b2a72891bea142dc311ecfd6` (working tree dirty)
- parent SHA-256: `0b9248c76a2b399791c47dbfa0d252b18284265f1dbca9ae8e66c0dd018c9f64`
- `bash scripts/run_her2_pipeline.sh` reruns the whole pipeline; stages are idempotent and resumable.
- per-stage manifests (`stage*_manifest.json`) record models, precisions, seeds, timings and peak memory.
